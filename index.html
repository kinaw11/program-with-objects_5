  <div id="content-one">
    <h1>Lesson One</h1>
    <em><b>HTML</b></em>
    <p class="my-paragraph">Hyper Text Markup Language, this is the main document type of the web, it glues everything together. HTML is made up of Text content this is what you see and Markup this is what it looks like. It also makes references to other documents, images and
      videos.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <em>THE WEB</em>
    <ul class="four">
      <li>Servers- computers that host the files that makeup the web</li>
      <li>Internet- the world’s largest computer network</li>
      <li>Browsers- a program that runs on your computer to display files found on the web</li>
      <li>URLS- How you refer to documents on the web.</li>
      <li>HTTP- protocol of the web</li>
      <li>Hyperlinks- links in between pages</li>
      <li> It was developed in the 1990’s</li>
      <li>30 billion pages</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <b>TAGS AND ELEMENTS OH MY</b>
    <br>
    <ul class="five">
      <li>Markup is made up of tags, tags are always contained within angled brackets most having opening and closing however some that are called void tags do not require closing tags.</li>
      <li> Opening Tag Content Closing tag</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <b>COMPUTERS ARE JUST NOT SMART</b>
    <br>
    <ul class="six">
      <li>Computers are not smart because they interpret instructions literally.</li>
      <li> This makes them very unforgiving.</li>
      <li>One small mistake will turn into huge problems</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <em>INLINE AND BLOCK</em>
    <br>
    <ul class="seven">
      <li>these are known as container Elements</li>
      <li>Inline are span, a br, img and strong</li>
      <li>Block is div, p, form,block elements form an invisible box around the content</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div id="content-two">
    <h1>Lesson Two</h1>
    <em>TWO LANGUAGES</em>
    <ul class="eight">
      <li>HTML CSS </li>
      <li>HTML- Controls the structure of a webpage</li>
      <li>CSS- Cascading Style Sheets language is used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <em>HTML STRUCTURE</em>
    <ul class="nine">
      <li>The Tree like structure of HTML comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them</li>
      <li>DOM- Document Object Model when programmers talk about the “DOM” they are talking about the tree like structure of a page.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <em>BOXES AND INDENTATIONS</em>
    <br>
    <ul class="ten">
      <li>Boxes, Boxes, Everywhere!!</li>
      <li>Everything is in a box</li>
      <li>The relationship between indented HTML and Boxes As you read an HTML document as text, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document the more indented an element is the more deeply nested its corresponding
        box is.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <em>TEXT EDITOR</em>
    <p>When writing code programmers use special text editors. These editors make the programmers life easier for example some text editors will automatically generate a closing HTML when you write an opening tag.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="content-three">
    <h1>Lesson Three</h1>
    <em> WHAT IS CSS?</em>
    <ul class="eleven">
      <li>CSS is all about Style</li>
      <li>Color, Shape, Size,Text,Images,Videos</li>
      <li>This sheet language is used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in markup language</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <em>REPETITION</em>
    <p>Repetition is one of the main things you have to look out for because through repition people have a tendency to make mistakes and not be consistent</p>
    <br>

    <div class="concept">
      <div class="concept-title">
        <h2> Computers</h2></div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p> A computer can be programmed to do whatever we want them to do. As long as we can write the program to the specifications that are needed.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div id="content-four">
      <div class="concept-title">
        <h2>What is a Computer Program ?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p> A program tells the computer what to do Computers can do any computation. Programs are a sequence of steps that a computer follows in order to complete something or be useful. Some examples of programs are games,mobile apps,web browsers all are
          computer programs.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="concept">
        <div class="concept-title">
          <h2> Programming Language</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>This is what programmers use to tell computers what to do or what they want to happen. An example of a programming language is Python.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="concept">
        <div class="concept-title">
          <h2>Grammar</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>So what is correct or not correct this is what grammar does With computer grammar everything has to be correct not technically correct this means our code has to be correct for the interpreters such as Python if not it will not run</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="concept">
        <div class="concept-title">
          <h2>Python</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>Python is an intepreter that runs our programs on the computer. Python is widely used.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="concept-title">
          <h2>Python Expressions</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>A Python expression is a legal Python statement. Print 5 + 1 is a valid expression, but print 8 + with no number at the end is not.</p>
          <div class="concept-description">Telling computers what to do Python- Test as you go after every step break into smaller bits The Variable What is a variable? Variables are names given to data that we need to store and manipulate in our programs. Variables are used to create
            a name, the value of the name equals the value it is referred to Always introduce a variable before you use it What does it mean to assign a value to a variable? Variables help code readability by using names, we can also change the value
            of things and store data. To do that we can name some data haircolor and define the variable haircolor using the following statement. haircolor=dark brown Then you can access and modify data by referring to it as haircolor. What are some ways
            that variables are useful? What is the difference between 5+5 and "5"+"5" The 5+5 is added and gives you the sum of 10… 5 is a number “5”+”5” in Python puts the numbers together 55….in Python “5” is a String
          </div>
          <p>What is the difference between what the equal’s means in math versus in programming? Note the = sign has a different meaning , In programming the =sign is known as a assignment sign. It means we are assigning the value on the right side of the
            =sign to the variable on the left.</p>
          <p>To write a comment # Symbol is used , comments start with the #symbol and everything after the symbol hash is ignored by python but the programmer can see it.</p>
          <div class="concept-title">
            <h2>Strings</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="concept-description">A sequence of characters surrounded by quotes “please don’t string me along” or ‘please don’t string me along’ you can use single or double quotes. If you start with a single quote you have to end with a single quote, If you start with a double
            quote you have to end with a double quote. For space in a string annotate this way ‘please don’t string me along ‘ you have to put a space before the quotation at the end. Strings and numbers will produce an err Example: name=’kina’ ‘kina’*12
            will not work But quotations will work in this manner name=’kina’ end=’!’ name + end *12 Kina!!!!!!!!!!!!
          </div>
          <div class="concept-title">
            <h2>Index</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="concept-description">An index, in your example, refers to a position within an ordered list. Python strings can be thought of as lists of characters; each character is given an index from zero (at the beginning) to the length minus one (at the end). For the string
            "Python", the indexes break down like this: P y t h o n 0 1 2 3 4 5 In addition, Python supports negative indexes, in which case it counts from the end. So the last character can be indexed with -1, the second to last with -2, etc.: P y t
            h o n -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 Integers these are numbers with no decimal parts -3,-2,-1,0,1,2 Float refers to numbers with Decimal points 12.345,-67.897 String refers to text List refers to a collection of data that are related. Instead of storing
            them as separate we can place them together Tuple are just like list but you cannot modify their value. The initial value is what will stay for the rest of the program.</div>
          <div class="concept-title">
            <h2>What is a Parameter?</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="concept-description">Parameters are what go inside the parenthesesFunctions These are simply pre-written codes that perform a certain task. Depending on how the function is written, whether it is a part of a class and how you import it, we can call a function by
            typing the name of the function or by using a dot notation. Some functions require us to pass data in for them to complete a task. </div>
          <div class="concept-title">
            <h2>Functions/Procedures</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="concept-description"> What are Functions/Procedures? they are prewritten codes that perform a certain task. In other words Input and Output taking a situation in and getting a different situation out. Differences between making and using a function, to make a function
            you start off by writing def at the beginning of your code like so def then giving the function a name like kina, blue, green, ect.. that will become values. We then specify what to do with the input. Example def kina(x) love= x+x return love
            In order to use a function you would write the name the put the value in parenthases like print kina(2) your answer would be 4 How do Functions help with repetition ? One and Done is the analogy i use. Create it one time and you never have
            to create it again. What if No return statement is involved? You will get the answer of none because you are not asking for a computation. def kina(x): love=x+5 love_overboard=kina(10) print love_overboard >>>None Telling Computers What To
            Do Compiler does it all at onceInterpreter interprets Group related facts into big ideas then summarize those ideas with a few sentences add these ideas and summarize to the HTML for your webpage: Topics to consider are: Computer, Program,
            Programming Languages, Interpreter, Python, Grammar, Python Expressions
          </div>
          <div class="concept-descrition">These are simply pre-written codes that perform a certain task. Depending on how the function is written, whether it is a part of a class and how you import it, we can call a function by typing the name of the function or by using a dot notation.
            Some functions require us to pass data in for them to complete a task.
          </div>
          <p>Boolean Value are True or False when comparing values they need to be the same type. Compare intergers with intergers and strings with strings</p>
          <p> Procedure is the same as Function What is print function they are prewritten code that defines a certian task What does it mean to Call a function, you do this by writing the function name followed by an open parentheses followed by the values
            for the required parfameters followed by a close parentheses always include print before calling a function Condition statements the program will proceed depending on coditions being met if,elif and else are utilized for this</p>
          <div class="concept-title">
            <h2>Lets get Loopy</h2></div>
          <div class="concept-description">For Loop executes a block of coderepeatedly until the conditions in the for statement is met on the other hand the While loop repeatedly executes while a certian condition is in place. Break Time braks are a way to stop loops </div>
          <p>Bugs, What are they? They are Errors in code you have to develp a stratergy to debug. The traceback function in Python has information of bug or what is going wrong in the code. There are 5 debugging stratergies. Examine Error Messages, Work
            from Examples of Code, Make sure examples work, Check and print immediate results, Keep and compare versions.</p>
          <div class="concept-title">
            <h2>Structured Data</h2></div>
          <div class="concept-description"> Strings and Lists are structured data strings are a sequence of characters list are a sequence of anything there are also different ways to use lists and different things you can do to a list like a list can be nested meaning there are list
            inside of lists. Mutation is changing the value of a part of the list and once that value is changed it can affect the value of other variables. Aliasing is two different ways to refer to the same object. Append means to add to a list and
            Concatenation is putting two or more lists together.</div>
          <div class="concept-title">
            <h2>How to solve problems</h2></div>
          <div class="concept-description">Understand the problem before you write the code What are the Inputs What are the outputs,Consider systematically how a human can solve the problem, Don't optomize prematurely the simpler the better. Pythonians Guide to all Problems in the Galaxy,

              <h1>Lesson Five</h1>
              <h2>PROGRAM WITH OBJECTS</h2>
              <div class="concept-title">
                <em><b>Object Oriented Programming</b></em></div>
              <div class="concept-description">
                <p class="my-paragraph"> Object Oriented Programming is based on the concepts of objects which are data structures that contain data in the form of fields also called attributes, and code in the form of procedures that are called methods. Another thing about objects is that they can modify and have access to the  data fields of the object with which they are associated with. While researching Object Oriented Programming i ran across several definitions that were great but i will explain it the way that helped me . I think of it as a Car, Meaning Make , Model, Style the Make of the car is equal to the Class, the Model represents the Instance to me and the Style is the function after you have placed everything in the instance to create the style that you want or type of car. You can make it what color you want, an automatic or a straight shift , even control the speed. Let's talk about what makes OOP valuable, the features that make OPP valuable are modularity and  re-usability. Modularity is the ability to divide a program into several subprograms this allows for programmers to divide up the work and work on project peices individually.  Another thing is  reuse, the same functions are put together in the same unit of programming code and separate functions are created as different units of code so that the code can be reused by other applications.  There in also information encapsulation which makes the code cleaner.

              <div class="concept-title">
                <em><b>Python Standard Library And Its Uses</b></em></div>
              <div class="concept-description">
                <p class="my-paragraph"> The library is a place you can find functions that can be used which are a collection of modules.There is also a library reference manual that describes the standard library that is distributed with Python. It also describes some of the optional components that are commonly
                  included in Python distributions.Python’s standard library is very extensive, offering a wide range of facilities as indicated by the long table of contents. There are built in functions, built in constants, buit in types, built in exceptions
                  this goes on and on, Great reference Guide. This definition and other information can be found at the python website<a href= "https://docs.python.org/2/library/">Click here to visit site.</a>

                <em><b>Terms That Are Important</b></em></div>
              <div class="concept-description">
                <ul class="twelve">
                  <li> Class: The best way to look at Class is seeing it as a blueprint with this blueprint you can create your Objects. Classes does have different fields like method, static method, constructor, field and static field. Creation of new classes are done with a Constructor. Behavior is controlled by Method and Field is what hold these states  </li>
                  <li> Instances: A copy of a class that represents an object and has its own memory for that instance, it is also seen as a unit of a class
                  </li>
                  <li>Instance Variable: These only have one per instance of a class and methods and variables are in the class but are not in the Method </li>
                  <li>Class variable: these occur once per class </li>
                  <li>Objects: when working with objects you learn that they have 2 things about them that help you to remember what they are and how they work , they have behavior and state, state is stored in fields and methods are the way they express thier bevaior.
                  </li>
                  <li>Constructor: Constructor is used to create a new instance of a class. This is a function always written in __init__ it has to always deal with self
                  </li>
                  <li>Self Variable: Self is a standard term even though it does not have to be used it is better it is an instance of what ever variable you are using</li>
                  <li>Instance Method: these are always apart or bounded </li>
                  <li> Inhertitance: I get it from my Mother is a clear way to explain it a child class gets it from a Parent class</li>
                  <li>Module: module is a python file made up of definitions that are used in a interactive instance or script, These definitions can be imported into other modules as well  they also have some function or variable to them.  </li></ul>
                  The listed website was very helpful in breaking down the definition of the above terms <p><a href="https://alfredjava.wordpress.com/2008/07/08/class-vs-object-vs-instance/">Click here to visit site.</a></p>

                <em><b>Thinking, Thinking, Thinking</b></em></div>
              <p> This part has been a bit of a struggle i know how to do it and i know how it relates but it is difficult to explain so here we go  from my understanding Class can be the same as Class in HTML but you can define that class as to what you want it to be once you do that your title and description can be instances of that class that you can build a function to communicate with and call information from those instances, This can happen for each instance in that class and does not need to be repeated. This is an example of abstaction where you get to the Meat and Potatoes of the situation, that is what abstraction is. Now i could not do these things without using the method below to help me make and outline that will support Analytical Thinking:  </p>
              <ul>
              <li>First start off with an outline and ask yourself the questions about, input, output, how to go from input to output.</li> <li>Second define your Class</li> <li> Be explicit in inheriting</li><li>Define a Constructor Function called __init__</li><li>You can then pass in title and description</li><li>Then create your instance function</li> <li>The HTML generator funtion inside Class was refactored, now when a function is called the title and description will be pulled from the object instance. This makes it easier you can change your objects in different ways</li>
